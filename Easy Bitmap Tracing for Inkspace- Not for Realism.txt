Handling images with text or edges with multiple olors for bitmap tracing In Inkspace.


Filters: Repeat these until edges only contain 1 color (well... two contrasted colors)
------------------
Colorblindness
Blend (not the simple one)
GReyscales
Contrast, high as itll go
(Saturation)?


Bitmap Tracing:
---------------
For crips edges, do above, then recolor after. Just copy image
Use multicolor greys, fewest scans, only Smooth corners (high) and optiimize (low). 

For color. Run the multicolor w/ as few scans as possible without missing portions. Match fill and combine any that mesh together. REcolor gryscaled crisp edges and mix with solid color pieces for a cleaner, smoother, nicer trace w/ minimal effort!!
