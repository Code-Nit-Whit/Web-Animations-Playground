## **Overview**

Welcome to my evolving playground for exploring the world of web animations! Here, you'll find a single page web application built that isn't built on the back of a framework or any libraries. This project will house a growing collection of my own web animations made using a variety of methods. Each animation reflects my journey in mastering these technologies and crafting interactive experiences. 

The web application will allow for the manual control of each animation using graphical elements, making it especially helpful for understanding and fine tuning the different elements and attributes behind them. I plan to continually expand the application's abilities to control, manipulate, and even alter imported animations, hopefully allowing it to become an educaitonal resource or  even a code-free animation web animation studio of sorts in the future. I look forward to makign this capable of handling a diverse set of user-imported animations, making it a valueable tool for for those inclined.

**Key Features:**

* **Diverse Animation Gallery:** From subtle transitions to expressive character movements, the gallery showcases a range of styles and problem-solving approaches.
* **Interactive Controls:** Dive deeper into the animations with intuitive controls for playback, rewind, skipping, and speed adjustment. Loop individual animations or entire sequences.
* **Code Exploration:** Uncover the intricacies of each animation with optional, integrated CodePen displays. See how the code works and freely experiment or use these simplified versions of the animations in your own projects. Alternatively, the complete source code for each imported animation is provided in a GitHub Gist embed.
* **Dynamic Updates:** New animations are seamlessly integrated through content injection, using GitHub Gists like a content managements system. At least that is currently the plan. Controls for imported animations are controlled with graphical elements at the user level. These ccontrols are implementsted using the Web Animations API. 

**Technologies Used:**

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** This project focuses on core JavaScript fundamentals for basic interactivity, demonstrating proficiency without relying on external libraries or frameworks for building a single page web application.
* **CSS:** Most animations come to life through creative and efficient CSS styling techniques. Most of these are then implemented with the Web Animations API for more granular control.
* **Modular Content Injection:** New content is dynamically added, enabling flexible updates and simplified management (including the use of [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/Code-Nit-Whit) for streamlined integration).
* **Web Animations API:** Both the main website animations and the controls for the injected animations are implemented using the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API#meet_the_web_animations_api)

## **Future Development:**

This project is constantly evolving as I expand my coding skills and knowledge. It may eventually transform into a more comprehensive portfolio showcasing diverse development skills and experiences.
