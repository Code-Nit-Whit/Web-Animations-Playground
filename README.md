## **Overview**

Welcome to my evolving playground for exploring the world of web animations! Here, you'll find a growing collection I've built myself using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and various animation techniques. Each animation reflects my journey in mastering these technologies and crafting interactive experiences.

**Key Features:**

* **Diverse Animation Gallery:** From subtle transitions to expressive character movements, the gallery showcases a range of styles and problem-solving approaches.
* **Interactive Controls:** Dive deeper into the animations with intuitive controls for playback, rewind, skipping, and speed adjustment. Loop individual animations or entire sequences.
* **Code Exploration:** Uncover the intricacies of each animation with optional, integrated CodePen displays. See how the code works and freely experiment.
* **Dynamic Updates:** New animations are seamlessly integrated through content injection, using GitHub Gists like a content managements system.(Or at least that is currently the plan)

**Technologies Used:**

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** This project focuses on core JavaScript fundamentals and animation techniques, demonstrating proficiency without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
* **CSS:** Animations come to life through creative and efficient CSS styling techniques.
* **Modular Content Injection:** New content is dynamically added, enabling flexible updates and simplified management (including the use of GitHub Gists for streamlined integration).

## **Future Development:**

This project is constantly evolving as I expand my coding skills and knowledge. It may eventually transform into a more comprehensive portfolio showcasing diverse development skills and experiences.
