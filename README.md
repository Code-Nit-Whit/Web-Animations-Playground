# Web Animations
A collection of web based animations of various element types and utilizing a variety of methods. The project is hosted within a single page application written in HTML & JavaScript. It is intended to act as a playground for manipulating and learning about web animations, and will be hosted for public use in the future. (Hopefully with the ability to import one's own animation projects) 

## A work in progress! Check back soon.
In the meantime, I will be sharing my animations' code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Code-Nit-Whit).
